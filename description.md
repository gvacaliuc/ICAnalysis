ICAnalysis is an addition to [wQAA](/wQAA/), analyzing the anharmonicity of the ICACoffs matrix, generated by wQAA.  It provides you with the number of conformations, the conformations' indices, and generates PDB files of the conformations whose n^th anharmonic value lies beyond 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean value of the n^th anharmonic moment.
